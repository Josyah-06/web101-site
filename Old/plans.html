        <p>
          After graduation, I plan to pursue a career in Cyber Security where
          I can contribute to keeping online data safe from any outside sources and keep sharpening my
          skills both with my career and working with groups. For whatever job I get if it is a up and coming
          or a already made company I'll make sure to keep honing my skills and work as hard as I can so that I am
          a valued worker for whoever I work for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Longer term, I’d like to become a higher up in a company and help mentor new developers, speak at meetups, and
          help the best I can so that the security for my company will be the best it can be. If I get the chace to be that 
          higher up I will not let my company fall either i'll make sure to get a good supporting cast of workers so that it isn't
          just me doing the work so I can do more and make sure lots of people have the skills needed to be a good cyber security worker.
